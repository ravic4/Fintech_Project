# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
​
## Background
​
As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.
​
One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.
​
In this homework assignment, you will:
​
* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.
​
* Research the domain and company.
​
* Write a detailed case study of the company.
​
* Upload your case study to your git repository.
​
This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions
​
### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.
​
**Note:** We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip ahead to Step 3.
​
* Payments/Billing
​
* Capital Investment
​
* Investment Management
​
* Wealth Management
​
* Enterprise Solutions
​
* Insurance (InsurTech)
​
* Mortgage/Real Estate
​
* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking
​
* Lending
​
* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
​
* Regulation Technology (RegTech)
​
* Open Banking
​
* Robo-advising
​
Remember that because FinTech is an evolving field, different FinTech reports may use different names and definitions for various domains and sectors (e.g., CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). In addition, you may come across lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.
​
### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.
​
Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.
​
Your company could be:
​
* A new, emerging FinTech company that is doing well in a particular domain. Examples include Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, and Coinbase.
​
* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology. Examples include Goldman Sachs’ Marcus, JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, and Apple Card.
​
* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.
​
### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.
​
We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.
​
**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project rather than on the company itself.

## **Mercado Libre Target Market, Technology, Competitors**
### **Target Market, and Product Need**
#### Mercado libre aims to help "democraticize finance" in the Latin America region. The population it serves is 650 million. According to the Inter American Development Bank, in LATAM, *"27% of adults do not have access to financial services"* [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/regulations-and-institutional-capacity-needed-advance-open-finance-latin-america-and-caribbean#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%27s,average%20for%20OECD%20member%20countries.). Furthermore, they found that the percent of adults **"borrowing from financial institutions is 30%, below the average for OECD member countries, lastly, financing gap for micro, small and medium sized enterprises is 35% of the regional GDP"* [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/regulations-and-institutional-capacity-needed-advance-open-finance-latin-america-and-caribbean#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%27s,average%20for%20OECD%20member%20countries.). This shows the need for Fintech products to help bring access to SME's and individuals, to both interact with SME's and for their personal savings. 
#### Mercado Libre's competitive strategy is its ability to provide users an ecosystem to both store and spend cash. It's ecommerce offerings provide an outlet for people to spend on money through, while its fintech platform assures that customers keep money with the firm. Mercado libre goes beyond a traditional ecommerce firm, and as a result it has high and growing economic moats. As a result, in November 2023, the firm reported 49 million users that use its Fintech product [Fintech Nexus](https://www.fintechnexus.com/mercado-libres-q3-profit-soars-on-strong-commerce-in-mexico-fintech-growth/). It's competitors such as: Amazon.com.mx or companies such as: UnDosTres only provide one service well (ecommerce for Amazon or Fintech for UnDosTres). By contrast, Mercado Libre benefits from a funnel of users ordering items through ecommerce platforms, and this allows the firm to explore Fintech options to help customers order online [UnDosTres](https://undostres.com.mx). 
<br>

### **Technologies Implemented**
#### Mercado Libre uses Amazon Web Services cloud services to help its users make seamless transactoins. The firm uses solutions such as *"Amazon SagemMaker, Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud"* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mercadolibreml/). 
#### The table below shows a deeper look into what each service does. 
<br>

| Amazon Service | Description | 
| ------------| -----------|
Amazon Sage Maker | Amazon Sage maker provides developers to *"Build, train, and deploy ML models with infrastructure & tools"*. Builders can use *"no code interfaces"* in addition to help deploy technologies rapidly and for any skill level [Amazon Sage Maker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). 
Amazon S3 | Amazon S3 enables firms to *store and protect any amount of data* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This allows a firm such as Mercado Libre to protect the data it has on its users (especially financial information)
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud enables Mercado Libre to host data on the cloud and enable developers to run applications and software [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mercadolibre-ec2/). 

#### The languages that developers on Mercado Libre use include the following 
| Segment | Services |
