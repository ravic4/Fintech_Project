## **Mercado Libre Target Market, Technology, Competitors:**
### **Target Market, and Product Needs**
#### Mercado libre aims to help "democraticize finance" in the Latin America region. The population it serves is 650 million. According to the Inter American Development Bank, in LATAM, *"27% of adults do not have access to financial services"* [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/regulations-and-institutional-capacity-needed-advance-open-finance-latin-america-and-caribbean#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%27s,average%20for%20OECD%20member%20countries.). Furthermore, they found that the percent of adults *"borrowing from financial institutions is 30%, below the average for OECD member countries, lastly, financing gap for micro, small and medium sized enterprises is 35% of the regional GDP"* [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/regulations-and-institutional-capacity-needed-advance-open-finance-latin-america-and-caribbean#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%27s,average%20for%20OECD%20member%20countries.). This shows the need for Fintech products to help bring access to SME's and individuals, to both interact with SME's and for their personal savings. 
<br>

#### Mercado Libre's competitive strategy is its ability to provide users an ecosystem to both store and spend cash. It's ecommerce offerings provide an outlet for people to spend on money through, while its fintech platform assures that customers keep money with the firm. Mercado libre goes beyond a traditional ecommerce firm, and as a result it has high and growing economic moats. As a result, in November 2023, the firm reported 49 million users that use its Fintech product [Fintech Nexus](https://www.fintechnexus.com/mercado-libres-q3-profit-soars-on-strong-commerce-in-mexico-fintech-growth/). It's competitors such as: Amazon.com.mx or companies such as: UnDosTres only provide one service well (ecommerce for Amazon or Fintech for UnDosTres). By contrast, Mercado Libre benefits from a funnel of users ordering items through ecommerce platforms, and this allows the firm to explore Fintech options to help customers order online [UnDosTres](https://undostres.com.mx). 
<br>

### **Technologies Implemented**
#### Mercado Libre uses Amazon Web Services cloud services to help its users make seamless transactoins. The firm uses solutions such as *"Amazon SagemMaker, Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud"* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mercadolibreml/). 
#### The table below shows a deeper look into what each service does. 
<br>

| Amazon Service | Description | 
| ------------| -----------|
Amazon Sage Maker | Amazon Sage maker provides developers to *"Build, train, and deploy ML models with infrastructure & tools"*. Builders can use *"no code interfaces"* in addition to help deploy technologies rapidly and for any skill level [Amazon Sage Maker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). 
Amazon S3 | Amazon S3 enables firms to *store and protect any amount of data* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This allows a firm such as Mercado Libre to protect the data it has on its users (especially financial information)
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud enables Mercado Libre to host data on the cloud and enable developers to run applications and software [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mercadolibre-ec2/).

## **Competitive Analysis:**

### **Sector information and domain**
##### Mercado Libre sits in the financial services & ecommerce sector. The table below shows its revenue breakdown: 
| Segment | Revenue 2022 | % breakdown|
| ------- | ------------ |-----------|
| Commerce Sales | $5,808 mm | 55%
Fintech Product Sales | $4,729 mm | 45% 
|**Total Sales** |**$10,537 mm**| **100%** 

##### *Table 5: Segment breakdown for Mercado Libre FY2022, source: [Mercado libre 2022 Annual Report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2831/0001099590-23-000007.pdf)*
#### Due to Mercado Libre's ecommerce synergies, it sits in between as a Fintech solutions giant and an ecommerce company. It provides loans, working capital needs, and credit-cards to both businesses and individuals. It competes with regional and international banks. This is the domain that Mercado Libre sits in (or in this case, the subsidiary: Mercado Pago sits in). It competes with both diversified ecommmerce giants such as Amazon.com and major banks in LATAM such as: Itau Unibanco Holdings [Investopedia Largest Banks in LATAM](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111314/10-biggest-latin-american-banks.asp). 
<br>

### **Trends between 2010-2023**
#### Since 2013, the major trends and innovation in Fintech has been the adoption of mobile phones. Mobile phones offer companies direct access to customers. The growth of Fintech was bolstered by the smartphone revolution. According to Esade Ramon Llull University, *"There has been a substatial increase in access to financial services during the last 10 - 15 years thanks to the prevalence of smartphones"* [dobetter.esade.edu](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/fintech-revolution). Over the past 10 years, major trends in this sector which have driven fintech are: declining storage costs for data. In 2010, $0.06 USD per GB, today that value is $0.02 [BIS.org](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap117.pdf). Furthermore, the size of this data has increased from ~1 Zetabyte in 2010 to over 50 Zetabytes in 2020 [BIS.org](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap117.pdf). The low cost and accumulation of data has fostered the creation of software to help sift through and analyze this data, and for Fintech, driven by smartphone penetration, this has allowed firms such as Mercado Libre to tap into these ever growing trends and gather all forms of data. Data that benefits Fintech firms include location, spending habits and history, contact information from social-media. These have helped comapnies create more creative identities and more individualized Fintech products. 
<br>

### **Major Companies in Fintech Space**
#### The major companies by revenue in the Fintech space are Stripe, Block (Square), Alibaba (Ali-Pay), PayPal. Block, Alibaba (Alipay), and PayPal are listed on public equities exchanges. These are the major firms that compete on a global space, with Square operating in the West and Alibaba (Alipay) operating in predominantly Asia.

## **Mercado Libre's Performance** 
#### Mercado Libre has performed incredibly well since its IPO in 2007. The firm has grown revenues from $137 mm in 2010 to $13,000 mm in sales as of November 2023 (TTM). 
| Years | 2010 | 2012 | 2014 | 2016 | 2018 | 2020 | 2022 | 2023TTM |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- | 
| Sales (in $ mm) | 216   | 373  | 556  | 844  | 1,440| 3,970| 10,540 | 13,214 |

<br>

#### The company's revenue growth has been fueled in part of its ecommerce offerings but catalyzed by its Fintech solutions which has created a near-impenetrateable competitive moat. 

#### The firm uses the following core metrics to measure value it provides to Fintech customers: Transaction Volume, which also has synergies with its ecommerce platform for measuring merchandise volume. Furthermore, the firm also measures the quality of loans to customers through measuring *"non-performing loan ratio"* [Mexico Business](https://mexicobusiness.news/ecommerce/news/mercado-libre-breaks-records-us1-billion-credit). For example, on November 3rd 2023, it was reported that *"It's (Mercado Pago) credit portfolio reached US$3.4 billion, with a robust Non-Performing LoanRatio (Net Interest Margin after Losses) of 37.4%"* [Mexico Business](https://mexicobusiness.news/ecommerce/news/mercado-libre-breaks-records-us1-billion-credit). Here is a more comprehensive list of metrics that the firm uses to measure fintech performance: 
<br>

| Key word | Definition | Mercado Pago's performance | 
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | 
| Non-performing loan ratio and Net Interest Margin| According to Investopedia: *"A loan that is in default due to the fact that the borrower has not  made the schedule payments for a specificed period* [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonperformingloan.asp). Net interest margin is *"a measure of the entt return on a bank's earnings assets"* [Science direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/interest-margin#:~:text=Net%20interest%20margin%20(NIM)%20is,Net%20interest%20income%2FEarning%20assets). | Mercado Pago's Net-Interest margin after loss stood to be 37.4% [Mexico Business](https://mexicobusiness.news/finance/news/citi-injects-us466-mercado-pago-mexico-brazil#:~:text=The%20credit%20portfolio%20achieved%20a,up%20for%20success%20in%202024%3F).
| Payment Volume  | Defined as the *"Gross value of payments through a given timeframe"* [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/blog/total-payment-volume#:~:text=Total%20payment%20volume%20(TPV)%20measures,%2C%20performance%2C%20and%20market%20postion.). | Mercado Pago's payment volume grew from $49 billion USD in 2020 to $123 billion USD in 2022 [Mercado Libre 2022 Annual Report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2831/0001099590-23-000007.pdf). 
Return on Equity | Formula measured as: Net income / Total Shareholder equity. According to investopedia, *"Banks emphasize ROE. Investors found that ROE is a much better metric as assessing the market value and growth of banks"* [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040815/what-level-return-equity-common-company-banking-sector.asp#:~:text=While%20most%20corporations%20focus%20on). | Mercado Libre's ROE trailing twelve month stood to be 44%, according to macrotrends, Mercado Libre has a very high ROE value [Mercado Libre Macro Trends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MELI/mercadolibre/roe). 
##### *Table 7: Key financial metrics and ratios used in Fintech*

#### Compared to other companies in the Fintech space, Mercado Libre is performing well. For example, the average net interest margin for US banks was reported ot be *"3% as of 1Q23"* [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061715/what-net-interest-margin-typical-bank.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,3%25%20as%20of%20Q1%202023.). If we compare the ROE of other Fintech companies such as: Square (Block), Alibaba (Alipay), and PayPal to Mercado Libre a pattern can be seen: 

| Company | ROE trailing twelve months |
| ------- | --- | 
| [Mercado Libre](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MELI/mercadolibre/roe) | 44.56%
| [PayPal](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PYPL/paypal-holdings/roe) | 18.94% | 
| [Alibaba](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BABA/alibaba/roe) | 7.56% | 
| [Block Inc.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SQ/block/roe) | -1.61% | 
##### *Table 8: ROE for select companies in Mercado Libre's domain*

## **Recommendations for Mercado Libre going into 2030** 
### **Expansion into the USA**
#### For Mercado Libre to truly become a powerhouse and draw in users for Fintech, it should continue to expand its operations into the United States of America and serve the hispnic community. According to US Department of Health, the Hispanic/Latino community represents 18.9% of the US Population [Minority Health](https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/hispaniclatino-health#:~:text=According%20to%202020%20Census%20data,the%20largest%20at%2061.6%20percent.). Mercado Libre could act as a bridge between LATAM and USA and foster the ecommerce transactions across americas. It's Fintech business and ecommerce synergies would entice SME's to hop on to Mercado Libre's fintech services and further strengthen Mercado Libre's competitive moat. 
<br>

### **Real-Estate Loans**
#### Mercado Pago could open up its doors to providing home loans in South America. According to the world bank, as of 2021, a blogpost was posted reporting that *"For too many women in LATAM, owning a home is out of reach"* [WorldBank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/latinamerica/too-many-women-latin-america-owning-home-out-reach). In central America, it was reported that *"less than 40% of women in this region have access to a bank account, and only 6% have taken out a mortage"* [WorldBank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/latinamerica/too-many-women-latin-america-owning-home-out-reach). Mercado Libre could expand its line of products into home loans by first appealing to the small businesses on its platforms before expanding out. The benefits for providing home loans is to provide a greater service to its loyal customers, it would further entice small businesses to sell on Mercado Libre's platform and also in turn that would boost the firm's competitive moat. 
<br>

### **Technologies that could be implemented** 
#### The technologies that could be implemented that truly benefit homeowners are using: Blockchain. This can be applied into a variety of segments for home ownership such as: Project financing, land and property registries, transactions, and payments. The benefits would be immediate to buyers, and Mercado Libre could help provide the home-equity loans and create an even more insulated competitive edge. The table below shows where in the value chain block chain could be implemented, and how: 
| Value Chain | Why it would be beneficial | 
| ----------- | -------------------------- | 
| Land and property registries | Land registery based on blockchain would allow for absolute transparency in land & property titles, and reduce the risk of fraud. 
| Investor/tenant information | Because of blockchain's transparency, landlords could know the exact identity of their tenants, and due to blockchain's record-keeping technology, it would reduce the risk of miscommunication between tenants and landlords. 
| Transaction tracking & due dilligence | Blockchain technology makes it easy for homeowners to prove ownership and allow for potential buyers to understand who the previous tenants are. This could greatly reduce fraud as tenant information is stored. 
| Seamless transactions | Through blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies could be used as a transaction tool between buyers and sellers, reducing the need for a "bank" as all paperwork would be tracked online | 
| Investors have more flexibility | Since all information is tracked on the blockchain, it would make it seamless for homeowners to build out more accurate financial models. With Mercado Libre's vast knowledge of people's payment information, financial models could be created with greater accuracy and provide investors the tools to understand the potential income from the property. 
##### *Table 9: How blockchain could benefit Mercado Libre, source: [Casper.network](https://casper.network/en-us/web3/blockchain/use-cases/real-estate/#)*
#### These technologies are important for my solution as they democratize real-estate for homeowners by reducing bureaucracy that usually would be involved when buying a home. Furthermore, it would also reduce any form of racial bias as people would be provided loans based on their ability to pay (as the blockchain would store that information). This technology could be carried over to Mercado Libre's ecommerce line by providing real receipt between buyers and sellers and cutout fraud entirely.
